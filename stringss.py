API may stand for Application Programming Interface, but humans have to be able to read the APIs, too; someone has to do
 the programming. Django REST Framework supports generating human-friendly HTML output for each resource when the HTML 
 format is requested. These pages allow for easy browsing of resources, as well as forms for submitting data to the 
 resources using POST, PUT, and DELETE.
